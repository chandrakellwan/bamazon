# Bamazon - Mock Online Store

bamazonCustomer.js

Bamazon allows the user to select and purchase products in a mock online store, as long as stock quantities are not depleted. After the items are selected for purchase, the app gives the user the total cost, and then it updates the quantities remaining in stock as needed.
 
Javascript and Node.js command line are used to mimic the virtual tech giant.
